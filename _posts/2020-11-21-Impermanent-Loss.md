## Introduction (slide 1)
Impermanent Loss (IL), or in simple speak, not yet a permeant loss, it is one of the hardest concepts in Defi for most people for most people to understand. 

Why really is IL and why all the fuss, and what do I need to know. 
In this video, I will explain what Impermanent Loss is using a simple example and easy to understand pictures. 
This one took effort, please watch all the video as I sum it up at the end. 

Intro
Here at GrassRootsCrypto, I like to keep it simple for the new users, as I can relate to the struggle new people have trying to understand all of this DeFi Cypto stuff.

Impermanent Loss (IL) It is a complex subject and there are many other videos on it showing the maths and formulas - I won't be doing that too much that. 
I want to be able give a basic understanding of the concept, without going into details, so you can decide what is best for you to do.

As with my previous video, this concept applies to most decentralised exchanges or DexExs within Defi but I will use BepSwap as an example. Check my video on basic concepts if you have not already. 

I’ll put all the links, plus some additional resources down in the description below for your reference. 

Lets get started

## Greater Intro (slide 2)
Impermanent Loss (IL) is a risk Liquidly Providers have when staking their assets in a liquidity pool. It is the potential difference in gains between holding and being a Liquidly Provider. 

Most people seem to freak out about it because it sounds scary, hard to understand and explain.

My holdings - 2 choices (Slide 3)
Say I have two assets - Rune and BNB - of say $1000 each - so $2000 of assets.

I have a choice - I can hold the assets in my wallet and wait for the price to go up or 
I can put them to work and become a liquidity provider by staking them into a liquidity pool, say on BepSwap.

Options…
Holding gives me gives me certainly of what I hold and I can easily track price movements, I can track that.  This is like holding shares or an investment house, waiting for the price to go up.

As a Liquidity Provider, I can get paid for staking my $2000 by collecting fees for people swapping assets, e.g. when swapping BNB for Rune or the other way. the rates are good,  Checking BepSwap - between 15% and 100%+ APY. 

However, like with most things, this has risks, one of which is called Impermeant Loss. Lets look at an example

## Example (Slide 4)
Here is my liquidly pool made up of Rune and BNB - that is a 50 / 50 split of a $1000 each - I've simplified this for purpose of explaining the key concepts of IL.
(Nice round unrealistic figures.)

In crypto, you may have heard, price is volatile, and sometimes it changes (joke). 

## (Slide 5) So let's say the BNB price goes up. The liquidity pool is no longer balanced at a 50/50 split.
Something like BepSwap is known as an Automated Market Maker (AMM) and they are programmed to hold and maintain a 50/50 split of a liquidity pool. TBH other ratios do exist, but let's just work with 50/50 split for now. 

So in this case the rebalancing process will sell BNB and buy RUNE to rebalance the liquidity pool, back to a 50/50 split. 

## (Slide 6) During the Rebalancing process, funds are lost (e.g. water splashes out of the pool). So while you might think the new value would be $2200, when the pool rebalances it is less than that. This is called IL.
In our example we lost $2.5 in rebalancing process - it is not the real number, just using it as an example. (lots of algebra to explain how it happens).

So let's compare this against holding. 

## (Slide 7) If you were to withdraw from the liquidity pool now (e.g. post rebalancing), you would get $2197.50, plus whatever fees you were paid (for being a liquidity provider). 
Thus you have missed out on the full benefits of the price gain, if you were holding by about $2.50, or 11% in our this example. 

This 'missing out' on the price gain is called Impermanent Loss. 

A few things that need to pointed out here.
	1. The 'loss' is on paper only, and is not final - hence not yet permeant - it will likely change tomorrow e.g. BNB could go back to it's original price and therefore there will be no IL. It becomes permeant when you withdraw from the Liquidity Pool.
	2. If both assets rise in price by the same percentage - than it is all good - the total pool value increases. It is when it is lop sided, or the pool becomes out of balance, it is a problem.
	3. Price will always change so the amount of IL or the amount you are 'missing out' on is always changing. 
	4. The fees you get paid as a Liquidity Provider may have been more or less than what you missed out on, you need to take away any fee revenue from what you missed out on to understand your actual or net loss/gain. 

 (New slide 8) (person asking why)

## So why do it? Why become a Liquidity Provider if I am exposed to the risk of Impermeant Loss?

AMM platforms like BepSwap (ThorChain) need Liquidity Providers to operate, so they make it very lucrative for Liquidity Providers by giving them a good share of the fees, offering them additional 'network benefits' and some provide additional tokens for providing liquidly, which also have value. 
It is risk many are willing to take as handsome rewards are on offer. 

It must be said, however, the more the price moves, the more IL becomes an issue, and the IL can be greater than the income generated by fees or network benefits.

Or put another way, when price movements are small, generally the income generated is more than enough to cover the Impermeant Loss but when price movements become very large, it may not be. 

Key questions to ask yourself
	1. What are you trying to achieve? e.g. hold assets in the hope they will go up - trying to somehow capitalise on every potential price increase OR provide a service and get paid for it - and not worrying too much about trying to get every potential temporary price increase.
	2. What is your time preference - are you in it for the short term or the long term? Are you interested in short trading OR long term asset appreciation and not concerned with short term volatility?

Remembering Impermeant Loss only be becomes permanent when you withdraw! 


## Summing up (Slide 9)

IL or in simple speak, not yet a permeant loss, happens during the rebalances process of the liquidity pool, which is caused by price movements. 
It is a risk Liquidly Providers have when staking their assets in a Liquidity Pool. 
The more the price moves (e.g. the more the liquidity pool becomes out of balance), the more IL becomes an issue. 
AMM platforms need Liquidity Providers to operate, so some may give benefits/rewards to Liquidity providers (particularly when they are new).

I don't know your situation or what is best for you, whatever you decide to do, I hope you have a better understanding of IL.

Put a comment to let me know if you understand the concept or not.

IL is more complex than what I've explained so I've added additional links in the description for your own research. 

Thanks and till next time. Bye
