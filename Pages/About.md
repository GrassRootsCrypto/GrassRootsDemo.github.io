GrassRoots Crypto was started to educate new users to the world of blockchain / Crypto. I understand the challange / fustration new people go through trying to lean and understand. There is so much informaiton out there, it is hard to know where to start.

I have been in the blockchain crpto space for over 2 years increaing my knowledege via books, paid courses, pod casts and other like minded people. 

I have helped many people understand and get into crypto over the last 12 months and currently I create videos for the THORChain community explaining beginner and advanced concepts. 

I am here to give you the informaiton you need to know to make the best decisions for yourself.
